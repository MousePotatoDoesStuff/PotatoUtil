# PotatoUtil
An utility project for Godot 4

This repository has been deprecated in favour of the [Mouse Potato Utils Plugin](https://codeberg.org/MousePotatoDoesStuff/MousePotatoUtilsPlugin) on Codeberg.

In order to use the currently sole function in the library, copy the library into your project and use

potatoutil.string.strmul(string,multiplier)
to multiply your string.
e.g. strmul("ha",2) -> "haha"
